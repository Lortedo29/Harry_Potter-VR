# Harry Potter VR

## Constraints

In groups of **6 students** (half as artist and vice versa), create a game in **3 weeks**.  
Go above the “way to let off steam” and the discovery of VR.   
  
Use VR to resolve some riddles and/or puzzles.  
  
## Our project
We decide to pretend to be a wizard by using controllers as a **wand**.  
Because of the diversity of spells in **Harry Potter**, we decide to choose the universe of the latter.
